# Track Spec: Initial Project Scaffolding and Dashboard Layout

## Overview
The goal of this track is to establish the foundation for Bdeck. This involves initializing a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, and creating the initial "Brutalist" terminal-multi-pane layout.

## Functional Requirements
- Initialize Next.js app with App Router.
- Configure Tailwind CSS for the project.
- Implement a responsive multi-pane dashboard layout (tmux-like grid).
- Create placeholder panes for:
    - Frequently Visited Sites (Links)
    - Project Timers
    - Todo List
    - Notes
- Ensure the layout follows the "Brutalist Utility" design guidelines (bold borders, functional spacing).

## Technical Constraints
- Framework: Next.js (TypeScript)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Layout: Grid-based terminal multiplexer emulation.
